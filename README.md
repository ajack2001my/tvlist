# tvlist
TV List, an HTML generator for keeping track of your favorite show from EZTV.ag or create a TV series search 
if EZTV does not have a dedicated show page as well as a quick search of Pirate Bay if episode is missing and 
check show status on TV.com.

To use, modify the TVLIST.TXT file to add/remove TV series you follow.  Then run the TVLIST.EXE to generate a 
TVLIST.HTM file you can then open in your web browser.  

-----------------------

Update from previous version:

Program has been expanded to not just quickly find your show torrents, but to get news about the series and 
search some popular torrent search engines.

Restructured the output as well as cleaned up the source code.  Looks more refined now compared to the 
previous "quick and dirty" look of the code.  

Removed the tvlist.png file as it is now embedded in the source code and will be auto-generated if not
found during the HTML generation.

-----------------------

Free Pascal 3.0.2 was used to compile this source code.  Has been tested in Win32 and Linux targets.
