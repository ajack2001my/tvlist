# tvlist
TV List, an HTML generator for keeping track of your favorite show from EZTV.ag or create a TV series search 
if EZTV does not have a dedicated show page as well as a quick search of Pirate Bay if episode is missing and 
check show status on TV.com.

To use, modify the TVLIST.TXT file to add/remove TV series you follow.  Then run the TVLIST.EXE to generate a 
TVLIST.HTM file you can then open in your web browser.

Update from previous version:

Program has been expanded to not just quickly find your show torrents, but to get news about the series you are 
following via the sites variety.com and tvline.com. TVList also now allows you to view the same shows online via 
yesmovies.to site.

Also made some cosmetic changes to the layout and updated the tvlist.txt file to show some of the changes to the app.

-----------------------

Free Pascal 3.0.2 was used to compile this source code.  Has been tested in Win32 and Linux targets.
