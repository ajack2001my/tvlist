# tvlist
TV List, an HTML generator for keeping track of your favorite show from EZTV.ag or create a TV series search 
if EZTV does not have a dedicated show page as well as a quick search of Pirate Bay if episode is missing and 
check show status on TV.com.

To use, modify the TVLIST.TXT file to add/remove TV series you follow.  Then run the TVLIST.EXE to generate a 
TVLIST.HTM file you can then open in your web browser.  

-----------------------

Update from previous version:

Code has been restructured, added a few more new websites to support your search/download efforts. Layout has 
changed and should be easier to use.


-----------------------

Free Pascal 3.0.2 was used to compile this source code.  Has been tested in Windows and Linux environments and 
on 32-bit and 64-bit targets.
