# tvlist v0.9.5

TV List, an HTML generator for keeping track of your favorite show from EZTV.re or create a TV series search 
if EZTV does not have a dedicated show page as well as a quick search on some torrent search engines if the 
episode is missing and to also check show statuses on TV websites.

To use, modify the TVLIST.TXT file to add/remove TV series you follow.  Then run TVLIST to generate a 
TVLIST.HTM file that you can then open in your web browser. Some elements can be customized via TVLIST.CFG which
should be self explanatory.

Update from previous version:

Code has been enhanced (small and too numerous to remember at time of writing this. I've also updated some of 
the URLs to support your search/download efforts.

Free Pascal 3.0.2 was used to compile this source code.  Has been tested in Windows and Linux environments and
